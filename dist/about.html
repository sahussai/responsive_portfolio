            I am an Electrical Engineering graduate from the University of
            Alberta. I have just recently completed my MSc. in Signals and Image
            Processing, and I am now in the process of looking to apply my
            skills. I have a strong passion for web development, and I am
            constantly looking to upgrade my skills. I am working towards
            becoming a full stack developer. With the programming skills I've
            honed over the years in my undergraduate and graduate classes, along
            with my increasing knowledge of web development, I want to create
            enagaging, intuitive, and elegant designs and applications that work
            with the user to accomplish any task.

            I worked as a web developer for a company that was developing a
            stock tracking and management system. The application was built
            using CakePHP, and MySQL. Working with a small team, I worked on
            adding new features to the site, including incorporating caching use
            Memcached to improve speed of queries. I was also worked on creating
            new styling, and fixing styling issues.

            As part of my Master's program at the University of Alberta, in the
            faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, I developed novel
            algorithms to perform colour operations on images captured by
            nonlinear image sensors. I developed an algorithm to perform colour
            correction, and an algorithm to perform demosaicking on images
            containing Salt-and-Pepper noise. Additionally, I developed the
            infrastructure required to test and validate both algorithms. I was
            able to publish a
